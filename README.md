# Bikesharing
## Overview
The objective of this project was to analyze and visualize data from a bike rental company to help inform decisions to improve the business. The data was submitted as a csv file. Pandas was used to change the 'Trip Duration' column of the data to a datetime data type. The adjusted data file was then imported into Tableau to complete the analysis and visualization.

## Results
Seven different visualizations were created using Tableau. The visualizations and a description of the results can be found below. 
<details>
<Summary> Top Starting Locations </Summary>
  
![Top Starting Locations](https://github.com/dkristek/bikesharing/blob/main/images/top_starting_locations.png)
<br>
  This visualization shows the areas in Manhattan with the highest amount of bike rentals. The larger dots with darker shades of blue represents a higher number of bike trips. One reason for certain areas having higher amounts of rentals could be due to those areas having larger tourist populations.

<details>
<Summary> Top Return Locations </Summary>
  
![Top Return Locations](https://github.com/dkristek/bikesharing/blob/main/images/top_return_loc.png)
<br>
  This visualization shows the areas in Manhattan with the highest amount of bike rental returns. The larger dots with darker shades of red represents a higher number of bike trips. One reason for certain areas having higher amounts of returns could be due to those areas having larger tourist populations. These return hotspots are similar to the top starting locations. This could be due to customers staying within Manhattan rather than travelling to other parts of New York City.

<details>
<Summary> Checkout Times </Summary>
  
![Checkout Times](https://github.com/dkristek/bikesharing/blob/main/images/checkout_times.png)
<br>
  This visualization illustrates the most frequent bike trip durations by minute and hour. The majority of the rentals last under one hour. The peak is around 5 minutes with over 140,000 bikes being rented. A possible explanation for this could be that customers are using the bikes for short distance travel rather than walking or using public transportation.

<details>
<Summary> Checkout Times By Gender </Summary>
  
![Checkout Times by Gender](https://github.com/dkristek/bikesharing/blob/main/images/checkout_times_gender.png)
<br>
  This visualization illustrates the most frequent bike trip durations by minute and hour with three lines representing genders (Male, Female, Unknown/Non-Binary). Each of the lines has a similar shape to the original Checkout Times graph. However, this graph shows that men make up the largest portion of the rental customer base.

<details>
<Summary> Trips By Weekday </Summary>
  
![Trips by Weekday by Hour](https://github.com/dkristek/bikesharing/blob/main/images/trips_weekday_hour.png)
<br>
  This visualization acts as a heatmap for the amount of rentals throughout each hour of the week. The twelve hour period between 7 A.M and 7 P.M is generally the most active rental period for each day of the week. On weekdays, 7 - 9 A.M and 5 - 7 P.M are the most heavily active bike rental times. This could suggest that customers are using the bikes to commute to and from work each day. While on weekends, the bike rentals are more evenly spread throughout the twelve hour block of heavy activity. This suggests that customers are using the bikes to travel through the city throughout their days.

<details>
<Summary> Trips By Gender </Summary>
  
![Trips by Gender](https://github.com/dkristek/bikesharing/blob/main/images/trips_weekday_hour.png)
<br>
  This visualization acts as a heatmap for the amount of rentals throughout each hour of the week separated by gender. The general trends seen in the previous Trips By Weekday graph can also be seen here in each gender category. However, the Male graph tends to be darker as they make up a larger portion of rental customers.

<Summary> Trips By Gender By Weekday </Summary>
  
![Trips by Gender by Weekday](https://github.com/dkristek/bikesharing/blob/main/images/trips_gender_weekday.png)
<br>
  This visualization acts as a heatmap for the amount of rentals throughout each day of the week separated by gender. The general trend is that subscribers make up the larger portion of the rentals. However, this is not true for non-binary category possibly due to a lack of data.

## Summary
The results from 'Top Starting Locations' and 'Top Return Locations' graphs show that Manhattan is the most popular area for bike rentals and returns. The 'Checkout Times' graphs suggest that most customers are renting the bikes for short distance travel as most rentals last less than 30 minutes and that men make up the majority of the customer base. The 'Trips by Weekday by Hour' graph shows that most rental activity occurs between 7 A.M and 7 P.M all week, with the mornings and evenings having the highest volume of rentals during weekdays. We can infer that most customers are renting bikes to commute to and from work. From the 'Trips by Weekday by Gender' graph we see that people who are subscribers make up the majority of the rentals and that they tend to rent more heavily on weekdays than on weekends. This backs up the inferrence that the customers are using the bikes to commute as it would benefit someone who uses the rental bikes that frequently to subscribe to the rental service.

While we have been able to make important observations from these visualizations, creating more visualizations would help greatly. One visualization that would provide good insight would be a second Checkout Time (Trip Duration) line graph that shows the frequency of the various trip durations for both customer types; subscriber, and customer (non-subscriber). This graph would provide insight in to how the two groups tend to use the bikes. Subscribers might rent the bikes more frequently than non-subscribers but for shorter lengths of time. This could allow the rental business to market to the two groups accordingly. A second visualization that would be useful would be the Top Starting Locations and Top Return Locations graphs filtered based on the day of the week. This would show whether certain locations are favored on certain days. This information could be used to adjust the bike allocation at each location to give a higher supply of bikes to the higher volume rental stations on each day.
